                When categorizing food for different emotional states, we focus on how caloric energy and nutrients can influence mood. Our food choices profoundly affect our emotional well-being, just as our emotions influence what we crave.
                For low moods, we recommend foods rich in complex carbohydrates and omega-3s, like whole grains and fatty fish, which boost serotonin levels. During stress, magnesium-rich foods and calming herbs provide natural relief. Happy or energetic states are best supported by protein-rich foods and fresh fruits.
                Understanding this food-mood connection helps create mindful eating habits that support both emotional balance and physical health, leading to better overall wellness.
